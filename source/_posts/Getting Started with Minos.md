Minos is a simple and retro styled Hexo theme which concentrates more on your ideas. Minos is very expressive as it has extensive plugin support, colorful code highlighting choices, flexible configurations and out-of-box multi-language support. Meanwhile, minimalism also makes Minos a great theme for both writers and readers who desire a better reading experience.
